# Dice-Betting-Game
Dice Betting Game in Python is a simple console-based game where the player bets money on a number between 1 and 6. The program rolls the dice six times using random values. The player wins if the chosen number appears and earns rewards based on its count.

## 🎮 How the Game Works
1. The player starts by entering an initial balance.
2. The player places a bet amount.
3. The player selects a number between 1 and 6.
4. The dice is rolled six times randomly.
5. If the chosen number appears:
   - The player wins money based on how many times the number appears.
6. If the number does not appear:
   - The bet amount is deducted.
7. The player can choose to play again or quit.
